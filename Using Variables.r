# here is an ecample of how you would compute the sum for the first 20 integers
20*(20+1)/2

# however, we can define a variable to use the formula for other values of variable n
n <- 20
n*(n+1)/2

# remember the '<-' is how you would assign values to an object 
n <- 25
n*(n+1)/2

# below is an example that would calculate the sum of the first 100 integers
n <- 100
n*(n+1)/2
